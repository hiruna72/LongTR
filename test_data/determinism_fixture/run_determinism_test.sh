# LongTR CI determinism test — the same input must produce the same VCF.
#
# Guards against doc/bug_poa_random_subsample.md: HaplotypeGenerator::poa() subsamples large read
# clusters, and used a std::random_device-seeded RNG. Identical runs therefore produced different
# candidate haplotypes, different ALT alleles and different genotypes — silently, at ~0.3% of loci.
# The bug survived from 2024-02 to 2026-07 because nothing checked reproducibility.
#
# Fixture (this directory): 2 public 1000G ONT samples over ONE chr21 locus known to exercise the
# subsampling path, plus a chr21 reference with real bases only where the reads land (N elsewhere,
# full length kept so coordinates need no shifting).
#
# FOUR assertions, and the third matters as much as the first two:
#   1. same seed, twice            -> byte-identical            (the regression itself)
#   2. default settings, twice     -> byte-identical            (any other nondeterminism)
#   3. two different seeds         -> MUST DIFFER               (proves the fixture still reaches the
#                                                                subsampling path; without this the
#                                                                test passes vacuously if the fixture,
#                                                                the cluster threshold or the
#                                                                admission logic ever changes)
#   4. reversed --bams order       -> byte-identical            (input ordering must not reach the
#                                                                calls; see below)
#
# poa() is only reached when a sample has >25% of its reads unadmitted, and only subsamples when a
# cluster reaches --poa-cluster-limit (default 30). This fixture is small, so the test lowers the
# limit to 5 to reach the path; assertion 3 is what verifies that is still true.
#
# On assertion 4. LongTR indexed read groups by the order reads drained out of a std::map whose key is
# prefixed with a per-BAM label, so the internal sample order was a function of --bams order, cohort
# size and BAM layout rather than of the data. Downstream (HaplotypeGenerator::gen_candidate_seqs and
# beyond) iterates samples in that order, so calls moved: on chr21 N=10, 14 of 35,703 records differed
# between per-file and one-multi-sample-BAM input, and reversing --bams reproduced the group-BAM
# result exactly. Fixed by sorting read groups by sample name in BamProcessor::read_and_filter_reads.
#
# CAVEAT, so nobody over-trusts this: unlike assertion 3, assertion 4 is NOT proven non-vacuous on
# this fixture — its single locus did not flip on reversal even with the bug present. It is here as a
# cheap guard on a real end-to-end invariant. The fixture that does reproduce the bug is
# test_data/poa_order_fixture (10 samples, chr21:14161568-14161856); a faithful single-locus subset of
# it is ~15 MB, which is why it is not wired in here. If you touch read-group ordering or the POA
# admission path, validate against that fixture, not this assertion.
